Open Source financial library written in python whose objective is to perform :
 - Monte Carlo simulations
 - Pricing of the main financial contracts
 
 The main goal is education and accessibility of the financial models to a large audience. So clarity will be prefered to performance (for which OpenQuantLib would be a better fit).
